## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values (e.g., age, embarked)
   - Dropped less relevant columns
   - Converted data types where needed

2. **Univariate & Bivariate Analysis**
   - Plotted age distribution and survival counts
   - Compared survival rates across:
     - Gender
     - Passenger class
     - Age
     - Fare

3. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plots
   - Histograms
   - KDE plots
   - Heatmaps for correlation

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Gender:** Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- **Class:** Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival.
- **Age:** Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Fare:** Higher fares loosely correlated with higher survival chances.
